					</div>

						<p>Checking the students’ works for plagiarism is a very topical issue nowadays for any “respectful” educational institution nowadays. On daily basis, colleges and universities are searching for a few decent online sources that will give numerous opportunities to check the course papers and even dissertations for plagiarism. The Ukrainians also made its own contribution to that by creating the startup project, titled as Noplag. Noplag is a plagiarism placement service set up for educational institutions worldwide with the ability to download a printed text online and in several seconds the service presents the searching results.</p>
						<p>This Ukrainian startup was lucky to become famous worldwide giving thanks to the American Starta Accelerator, an acceleration program lasting for 14 weeks for East European technology startups launched by Starta Capital that is designed to overcome cultural differences, adapt business models, organize sales and attract investment. It supports business in the early stages of development and helping to promote ideas on foreign markets.Not so much time ago, the American Starta Accelerator selected the Ukrainian startup - Noplag. The Ukrainian project will receive $ 130,000 and the next step will be the acceleration in New York.</p>
						<p>Startups were selected on the basis of several criteria: optimal cost ratio, ability to enter the international market and personal qualities of the project's founder. The Ukrainian Noplag became the best one in the sphere of plagiarism investigations due to its innovational approach to checking methods and a decent digital background.</p>
						<p>The service can replace any kind of a software program for setting up, executing and controlling tasks between a teacher and a student and a manager and its employees as well. It will definitely become extremely popular and useful for the content writers who want to be sure that their “creations” are really unique ones. In addition, the service is designed for site owners and individual users that will find it as a comfortable tool for controlling plagiarism for their personal purposes.</p>
						<p>The Ukrainian Noplag has uncompromisingly deserved this recognition as it made a real evolution by improving the plagiarism searching mechanism and creating a perfect helper-outer for the writers worldwide.</p>

									<h3>Igor Sikorsky — a Ukrainian Founder of Aircraft Designing</h3>
									<p>Igor Sikorsky was lucky to realize the children's dream and become one of the Ukrainian brightest personalities – a desperate pilot of his own airplanes. Sikorsky cherished his dream since childhood. The boy loved to listen to the mom's stories about the universe and the mystery of the stars. His role model was Leonardo da Vinci who dreamt about creating an “iron bird”.</p>
									<h4>Prophetic Dream</h4>
									<p>One day, after reading the novel by Jules Verne, the boy dreamed that he was on board a flying ship in a luxurious salon with the panoramic view of a sea and a palm island. In thirty years his dream came true. He saw that on board of his own plane. Being a student, he tried to track all the new items that appeared in the technical fields, after school Igor spent time constructing something in his father’s garage.</p>
									<h4>The First Development</h4>
									<p>In 1908, Sikorsky began working on developing of his first helicopter. The works were carried out in the courtyard of the parental estate. But, unfortunately, the first helicopter could not escape into the air. However, his tests revealed many features that should be taken into account when designing such devices. The thing was not in the mistakes of the developer but in the absence of the engine of the required weight and power. The young designer understood that and began developing his first airplane. Finally, he succeeded.</p>
									<h4>Own Studio</h4>
									<p>Sikorsky found support in his friends and founded his own studio where the successful models P-3, P-4, P-5, and C-6 were constructed. In 1909 Sikorsky presented the airplanes of his own design that caused enthusiasm in Kiev on a sporting holiday on the Pechersk hippodrome. Thanks to Sikorsky, Ukraine is “proud of” light fighter jets, sea scouts, light scout fighters, two-engine bombers, i.e. a complete fleet of all types of military aircraft.</p>
									<h4>Success in USA</h4>
									<p>In 1919 Sikorsky migrated to USA and founded the “Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation”. That period was quite complicated in his career. To prevent the corporation bankruptcy, its vice-president Sergii Rahmaninov (a famous Russian composer) presented Sikorsky a 5-hundred USD bank cheque. In 1929 the corporation financial status improved, Sikorsky returned money including cum interest back to Rahmaninov.</p>
									<p>By 1939 Sikorsky constructed about 15 types of airplanes including S-51, S-55, S-56, S-61, S-64, and S-65. In 1939 the first testing airplane Vought-Sikorsky 300, constructed in USA, escaped the land. His airplanes crossed the Atlantic (S-61; 1967) and the Pacific (S-65; 1970) oceans with aerial refueling. That was a real revolution in aircraft sphere. The pearl of his collection is the S-58 model that is the last Sikorsky’s airplane, before his retirement. By its characteristics, it surpassed all first-generation propellers. His numerous modifications were exploited for both military and civilian purposes in almost fifty countries. Several countries have bought licenses for their production. Many of these machines are used to this day.</p>
